/**
 * ORDERS — the Apex↔MedSource seam.
 *
 * MedSource is a separate fulfillment system: its own database, its own
 * warehouse floor, reachable only over HTTPS. Apex places the order; MedSource
 * picks, QCs and ships it. Everything below exists because of a specific
 * failure we watched happen in the audited system.
 *
 * DECISION 1 — ONE ID, END TO END.
 *   The audited integration carried three key formats (an internal numeric id,
 *   a partner-side reference, and a human "order number" printed on the pick
 *   sheet). Nothing joined cleanly, so when an order went sideways nobody could
 *   answer "is this the same order?" without a human eyeballing a spreadsheet.
 *   Apex issues exactly one id (`Order.id`) at draft time and that id is the
 *   correlation key on every request, every webhook, every ledger row and every
 *   screen. `medsourceRef` is kept ONLY as an opaque, display-and-support
 *   value — it is never a join key, never looked up by, never trusted.
 *
 * DECISION 2 — ONE STATUS VOCABULARY.
 *   Status crossed the wire as an unvalidated string. A single typo
 *   ("in_transit" vs "in transit") wrote a value no view filtered on, and the
 *   order silently vanished from every board — still real, still owed to a
 *   patient, invisible to staff. `OrderStatus` is a closed union, and the only
 *   way a partner string becomes one is `parseMedSourceStatus`, which returns
 *   null for anything it does not recognize. Unknown input is an incident, not
 *   a new status.
 *
 * DECISION 3 — THE OUTBOX EXISTS BECAUSE THE WEBHOOK LIED.
 *   The "ready to ship" webhook fired exactly once, inside a swallowed catch,
 *   with no retry. If that one HTTP call was lost — deploy, timeout, 503 — the
 *   order froze forever, because the tracking poller skipped orders in that
 *   status. There was no queue, no dead-letter, no alarm. `OutboxEntry` is the
 *   durable at-least-once record of an intent to tell the other side something:
 *   it is written in the same transaction as the state change, retried on a
 *   deterministic backoff, and never silently dropped. An undelivered outbox
 *   entry is a visible, alertable row — not a lost log line.
 *
 * DECISION 4 — EVERY STATE CHANGE CARRIES AN ACTOR.
 *   The audited status history recorded status + timestamp and nothing else.
 *   You could see an order was cancelled; you could not see who cancelled it,
 *   or whether "who" was even a person. `OrderStatusEvent.actor`,
 *   `actorRole` and `source` are required. "medsource" and "carrier" are
 *   actors too — machines are accountable here the same as people.

   * ── THIS IS NOT A TRACEABILITY HOOK TODAY. ────────────────────────────────
   * The previous comment described it as "the hook that makes a recall
   * answerable ('which patients received lot BPC-2604A?') without a phone
   * call". Someone will read that as spec, so, plainly:
   *
   *  - Nothing reports a lot. There is no MedSource integration; the field is
   *    populated by `lib/mock/orders.ts:308`, which SYNTHESIZES a string from a
   *    third private catalog's `lotPrefix` plus a seeded suffix. The value has
   *    never been on a shelf.
   *  - It therefore does not join. Fabricated order lots collide with the real
   *    lots in `lib/mock/inventory.ts` only by chance.
   *  - No query consumes it. Grep for `byLot` or `recall`: zero selectors.
   *  - It covers shipped lines only. In-clinic administration records nothing
   *    and never decrements `inventory.quantity`, so the patients most likely
   *    to be in a recall cohort are the ones with no row at all.
   *
   * FOR THE CLAIM TO HOLD, all four must be true: `lotRef` is set from a real
   * `InventoryLot.id` at pick time (partner-reported or clinic-scanned), the
   * value is validated against inventory rather than trusted, a dispense event
   * decrements the lot, and a `patientsForLot(lotId)` selector exists and is
   * exercised. Treat `lotRef` as a display string until then.
